    <p class="bio-text">Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="bio-text">So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. We'll play with clouds today. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. There it is. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. There comes a nice little fluffer.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="bio-text">Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="bio-text">Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Do an almighty painting with us. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play.
